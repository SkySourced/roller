# roller
A game in JavaScript

## plan
A log (circle) rolls up a sawmill and jumping and dashing over them. You can bounce off walls to jump to higher platforms and your speed increases over time as you get higher. The camera also scrolls faster as you get higher. If you fall below your highest platform, the game is over and there is a restart screen showing your score (how high you got). The canvas focuses on the height of the log which can go infinitely. The in-game UI shows your score. There is also a start screen showing the controls, Z to jump and X to dash.
